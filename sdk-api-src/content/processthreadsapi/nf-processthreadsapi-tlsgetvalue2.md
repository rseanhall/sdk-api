## -description

Retrieves the value in the calling thread's thread local storage (TLS) slot for the specified TLS index. Each thread of a process has its own slot for each TLS index.

## -parameters

### -param dwTlsIndex [in]

The TLS index that was allocated by the [TlsAlloc function](nf-processthreadsapi-tlsalloc.md).

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is the value stored in the calling thread's TLS slot associated with the specified index. If *dwTlsIndex* is a valid index allocated by a successful call to [TlsAlloc](nf-processthreadsapi-tlsalloc.md), this function always succeeds.

If the function fails, the return value is zero.

## -remarks

TLS indexes are typically allocated by the [TlsAlloc](nf-processthreadsapi-tlsalloc.md) function during process or DLL initialization. After a TLS index is allocated, each thread of the process can use it to access its own TLS slot for that index. A thread specifies a TLS index in a call to [TlsSetValue](nf-processthreadsapi-tlssetvalue.md) to store a value in its slot. The thread specifies the same index in a subsequent call to **TlsGetValue2** to retrieve the stored value.

**TlsGetValue2** was implemented with speed as the primary goal. The function performs minimal parameter validation and error checking. In particular, it succeeds if *dwTlsIndex* is in the range 0 through (**TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE**â€“ 1). It is up to the programmer to ensure that the index is valid and that the thread calls [TlsSetValue](nf-processthreadsapi-tlssetvalue.md) before calling **TlsGetValue2**.

This function is identical to [**TlsGetValue**](nf-processthreadsapi-tlsgetvalue.md) except that it doesn't set the thread's last error. Applications calling this function should avoid using 0 as a valid value, because **GetLastError** cannot be called to check if the function failed.
