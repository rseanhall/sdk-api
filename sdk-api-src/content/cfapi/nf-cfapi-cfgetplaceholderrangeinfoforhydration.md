## -description

Gets range information about a placeholder file or folder. This range information is identical to what [CfGetPlaceholderRangeInfo](nf-cfapi-cfgetplaceholderrangeinfo.md) returns. However, it doesn’t take a *fileHandle* as a parameter. Instead, it uses *ConnectionKey*, *TransferKey*, and *FileId* to identify the file and the stream for which range information is being requested.

The platform provides *ConnectionKey*, *TransferKey*, and *FileId* to all callback functions registered via [CfConnectSyncRoot](nf-cfapi-cfconnectsyncroot.md) and the provider could use these parameters to obtain range information about a placeholder from the **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** callback without requiring it to open a handle to the file.

If the file is not a cloud files placeholder, the API will fail. On success, range information is returned according to the specific *InfoClass* requested.

> [!NOTE]
> This API is available only if the `PlatformVersion.IntegrationNumber` obtained from [CfGetPlatformInfo](nf-cfapi-cfgetplatforminfo.md) is `0x600` or higher.

## -parameters

### -param ConnectionKey [in]

An opaque handle created by [CfConnectSyncRoot](nf-cfapi-cfconnectsyncroot.md) for a sync root managed by the sync provider. It is returned also in **CF_CALLBACK_INFO** in the **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** callback and other callbacks.

### -param TransferKey [in]

The opaque handle to the placeholder file for which **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** callback has been invoked. It is also returned in **CF_CALLBACK_INFO** in the **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** callback. This can alternatively be obtained by [CfGetTransferKey](nf-cfapi-cfgettransferkey.md) if the API is not being invoked from **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** Callback.

### -param FileId [in]

A 64bit file system-maintained volume-wide unique ID of the placeholder file/directory to be serviced. Like *TransferKey*, this is returned in **CF_CALLBACK_INFO** in the **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** and other callbacks so that the provider doesn’t have to retrieve it again.

### -param InfoClass [in]

Types of the range of placeholder data. The value can be one of the following:

| Value | Description |
|--------|--------|
| CF_PLACEHOLDER_RANGE_INFO_ONDISK | On-disk data is data that is physical present in the file. This is a super set of other types of ranges. |
| CF_PLACEHOLDER_RANGE_INFO_VALIDATED | Validated data is a subset of the on-disk data that is currently in sync with the cloud. |
| CF_PLACEHOLDER_RANGEINFO_MODIFIED | Modified data is a subset of the on-disk data that is currently not in sync with the cloud (i.e., either modified or appended.) |

### -param StartingOffset [in]

Offset of the starting point of the range of data. *StartingOffset* and *RangeLength* specify a range in the placeholder file whose information as described by the *InfoClass* parameter is requested

### -param RangeLength [in]

Length of the range of data. A provider can specify `CF_EOF` for *RangeLength* to indicate that range for which information is requested is from *StartingOffset* to end of the file.

### -param InfoBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that will receive the data. The buffer is an array of **CF_FILE_RANGE** structures, which are offset/length pairs, describing the requested ranges.

### -param InfoBufferSize [in]

The length of *InfoBuffer* in bytes.

### -param InfoBufferWritten [out, optional]

Receives the number of bytes returned in *InfoBuffer*.

## -returns

If this function succeeds, it returns `S_OK`. Otherwise, it returns an **HRESULT** error code. Some common error codes are listed in the following table:

| Error code | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| HRESULT_FROM_WIN32( ERROR_HANDLE_EOF ) | This means that *StartingOffset* >= the position of the end of the file. |
| HRESULT_FROM_WIN32( ERROR_MORE_DATA ) | This implies that the next **CF_FILE_RANGE** entry doesn't fit in the provided buffer. The caller should verify if any entry is received or not using the returned *InfoBufferWritten* value. |

## -remarks

While an API to query hydrated file ranges of a placeholder already exists, a new API was needed for improving reliability of the platform.

The existing API, [CfGetPlaceholderRangeInfo](nf-cfapi-cfgetplaceholderrangeinfo.md), requires an opened handle to a file and then triggers a **FSCTL_HSM_CONTROL** using that handle. Providers/Sync Engines normally use this API to assess which portions of the file aren’t hydrated from the context of a **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** callback invoked by the filter to hydrate the file to satisfy an IO.

A mini filter in the IO stack could issue data scan on the file when the provider/Sync engine tries to open a handle to the file to be passed as a parameter to [CfGetPlaceholderRangeInfo](nf-cfapi-cfgetplaceholderrangeinfo.md). Alternatively, a mini filter could block the **FSCTL_HSM_CONTROL** that **CfGetPlaceholderRangeInfo** triggers internally.

The **cldflt** filter is designed to invoke just one **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** callback per required file range for hydrating the file. As a result of either of above cases, either the data scan is stuck behind the original **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** or the **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** is stuck behind the blocked [FSCTL](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/4dc02779-9d95-43f8-bba4-8d4ce4961458). This causes a deadlock in the hydration path.

Hence, this API is needed. It performs the same functionality as [CfGetPlaceholderRangeInfo](nf-cfapi-cfgetplaceholderrangeinfo.md), but communicates to the filter directly using filter message ports bypassing the intermediate IO stack. Therefore, no intermediate mini filter can either obstruct the **CreateFile** or the **FSCTL_HSM_CONTROL**.

Note that the caller always has the *ConnectionKey* obtained via [CfConnectSyncRoot](nf-cfapi-cfconnectsyncroot.md). It can obtain *TransferKey* via [CfGetTransferKey](nf-cfapi-cfgettransferkey.md) and obtain *FileId* using [GetFileInformationByHandle](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfileinformationbyhandle). But this approach needs a handle to be opened to the file and hence is no different than using [CfGetPlaceholderRangeInfo](nf-cfapi-cfgetplaceholderrangeinfo.md).

To summarize, when range info is needed from the context of a **CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA** callback, this API should be used. In all other cases, including when the provider wants to hydrate the file without being requested by the filter, [CfGetPlaceholderRangeInfo](nf-cfapi-cfgetplaceholderrangeinfo.md) should be used. The platform can’t recognize which API is called in a specific context and hence the onus is on the provider/Sync Engine to do the right thing.

## Examples

This is a simple example where the function passes an *InfoBuffer* sufficient to retrieve only one **CF_FILE_RANGE** entry at a time. In practice, the caller could pass an *InfoBuffer* that could correspond to multiple **CF_FILE_RANGE** entries per invocation of the API. Error code **HRESULT_FROM_WIN32( ERROR_MORE_DATA )** could be used to pass a larger buffer if need be.

// ******************************************************************************************************
// From within the CF_CALLBACK_TYPE_FETCH_DATA Callback, the provider can use
// g_PlatformInfo.IntegrationNumber to see if the new API is supported. If it is, the provider can pass
// ConnectionKey, TransferKey and FileId along with other parameters to obtain information about file
// ranges which have already been hydrated.
// *******************************************************************************************************

// The provider could obtain file ranges that are hydrated like this:
std::vector<CF_FILE_RANGE> hydratedRanges = GetFileRangesFromCallback( CallbackInfo->ConnectionKey,

                                                                       CallbackInfo->FileId,
                                                                       CF_PLACEHOLDER_RANGE_INFO_ONDISK
