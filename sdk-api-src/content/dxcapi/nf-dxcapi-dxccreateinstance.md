## -description

Creates a single uninitialized object of the class associated with a specified CLSID. Also see [DxcCreateInstance2](./nf-dxcapi-dxccreateinstance2.md).

## -parameters

### -param rclsid

The CLSID associated with the data and code that will be used to create the object.

### -param riid

A reference to the identifier of the interface to be used to communicate with the object.

### -param ppv

Address of pointer variable that receives the interface pointer requested in *riid*. Upon successful return, `*ppv` contains the requested interface pointer. Upon failure, `*ppv` contains NULL.

## -returns

While this function is similar to **CoCreateInstance**, there's no COM involvement.

## -remarks

To make it more convenient for you to use **GetProcAddress** to call **DxcCreateInstance**, the **DxcCreateInstanceProc** typedef is provided:

```cpp
typedef HRESULT (__stdcall *DxcCreateInstanceProc)(
  _In_ REFCLSID   rclsid,
  _In_ REFIID     riid,
  _Out_ LPVOID*   ppv
);
```
